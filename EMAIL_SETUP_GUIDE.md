EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
JASON_EMAIL=j@flawlessfini.sh
```

## Gmail Setup (Recommended)

2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
   - Use this password as `EMAIL_PASS`

## Alternative Email Providers

EMAIL_PORT=587
```

### Yahoo

## What Happens When Someone Books

When a customer makes a booking (with or without deposit), you'll receive a professional email with:

- âœ… Customer name, phone, and email
- ðŸ“… Booking date and time
- ðŸ’° Deposit amount and payment method
- ðŸš— Vehicle information (if provided)
