# Replace Jason's Photo - Quick Fix

## Current Status âœ…
- The image path is working correctly

- You just need to replace the placeholder with your actual photo

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Save Your Jason Photo
Save your Jason headshot photo to your computer (any name is fine)

### Step 2: Replace the Placeholder
1. **Open Finder**
2. **Navigate to**: `/Users/br14r/Flawless-Finish-Ceramic-Coating/Flawless-Finish-Ceramic-Coating/images/`
3. **Find the file**: `jason-headshot.jpg`
4. **Drag your actual Jason photo** over the `jason-headshot.jpg` file
5. **Make sure it keeps the same name**: `jason-headshot.jpg`

### Step 3: Test
1. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Scroll to the About Me section**
3. **You should see Jason's actual photo**

## Alternative Method (Terminal)
If you have the photo saved somewhere else:
```bash
# Replace with your actual photo path
cp /path/to/your/jason-photo.jpg /Users/br14r/Flawless-Finish-Ceramic-Coating/Flawless-Finish-Ceramic-Coating/images/jason-headshot.jpg
```

## Current Image
Right now it's showing the logo as a placeholder. Once you replace it with Jason's actual photo, it will display correctly!

The website is working perfectly - just need the real photo! ðŸŽ‰
